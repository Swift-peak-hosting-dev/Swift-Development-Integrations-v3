# Welcome to Swift Peak File Selector!

This application provides a user-friendly way to manage files between two folders, offering advantages over the default Windows File Explorer.

## How to Use:

1. **Select Source Folder**: Click on the "Select Folder 1" button to choose the source folder.
2. **Select Destination Folder**: Click on the "Select Folder 2" button to choose the destination folder.
3. **View and Manage Files**: Use the file list boxes to view the files in each folder. Unlike the Windows default method, selecting files here will not be affected by scrolling, making it easier to manage large sets of files.
4. **Select Files to Move**: Select the files you want to move by clicking on them. You can also use Ctrl + left-click to select multiple files.
5. **Move Selected Files**: Click on the "Move Selected Files" button to move the selected files from one folder to another.
6. **Refresh List**: Click on the "Refresh List" button to show live files in each folder. Please note, this is not a copy script, so it will remove the files from the old folder. I will update it soon so you can have an option and a few more features.

Happy file selecting!
